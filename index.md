# AVE Analysis, Modelling and Prediction (AMP) Workstream 

The [Atlas of Variant Effects (AVE) Alliance](https://www.varianteffect.org) aims to propel systematic and extensive measurement and analysis of the impact of genetic variants on functional elements of human, model organism and pathogen genomes, to further the understanding of genes, gene products and their regulation and empower the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.

The Analysis, Modelling and Prediction (AMP) Workstream (formerly known as Variant Scoring Tools, Methods and Standards workstream) develops strategies to assess variant scoring, error estimation and visualization methods. AMP will evaluate the impact of experimental design choices like library complexity, number of independent cells and sequencing depth on the accuracy of scoring and error estimation. AMP will also be responsible for developing reporting standards to enable evaluation of the quality of MAVE datasets in terms of internal controls, replicability and minimal information to be included.

Members of this group:

* Assess alternative methods for primary data analysis and visualization, e.g. to go from barcode counts to variant scores and error estimates to generate viewable variant effect maps
* Develop strategies to evaluate primary analysis methods, e.g., replication between groups, or comparison with population allele frequencies or computational predictors.
* Evaluate the impact of experimental design choices (e.g., library complexity, number of independent cells) on the validity of scores and error estimates.

All members are expected to follow the [AVE Code of Conduct](https://www.varianteffect.org/code-of-conduct).
